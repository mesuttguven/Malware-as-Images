                                            STATIK MALWARE ANALAYSIS WITH CNNs:

This Colab consist of a Lab from the Course "Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity (SGB 524)" at TOBB ETU University.\

First, an image dataset is created from the Portable Executables(PE). Original PEs are gathered from;
 - (https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo) for Malicious samples, and
 - PC Magazine's The Best Free Software of 2020 (https://www.pcmag.com/picks/best-free-software) for Benign samples. 
 
 Second, Data Augmentation is executed on Generated RGB Imaage versions of the both benign and malign samples.
 
 Third, A Simple CNNs model is defined, compiled and fit for 100 epochs. 
 Results show that after 100 epoch, the trained model can accomplish nearly 90% aaccuracy.
